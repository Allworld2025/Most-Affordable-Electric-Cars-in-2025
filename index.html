            <h2>AI Overview: The Rise of Affordable EVs</h2>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer a luxury reserved for the wealthy. In 2025, advancements in battery technology and manufacturing have driven down costs, making EVs accessible to a wider audience. With federal tax credits of up to $7,500, some models are priced as low as $25,000 after incentives. Popular affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Hyundai Kona Electric, and Tesla Model 3 offer ranges over 250 miles, fast-charging capabilities, and modern tech, making them practical for daily commutes and road trips. This article explores the top affordable EVs, recent trends, customer feedback, and expert tips for buyers.</p>

            <h2>Unique Insights: Why Affordable EVs Are a Game-Changer</h2>
            <p>Switching to an electric vehicle doesn’t just save money on fuel—it’s a lifestyle shift. Affordable EVs combine low operating costs with eco-friendly driving, reducing carbon footprints by up to 50% compared to gas-powered cars. For instance, a typical EV owner can save around $1,000 annually on fuel and maintenance due to fewer moving parts and no oil changes. The expansion of charging networks, including Tesla’s Supercharger compatibility for non-Tesla EVs, has made long-distance travel more feasible. Additionally, EVs like the Nissan Ariya offer compact designs ideal for city dwellers, while models like the Kia EV9 cater to families needing space without sacrificing affordability.</p>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When considering an EV, check for local incentives beyond federal tax credits, as some states offer additional rebates or charging station subsidies.
